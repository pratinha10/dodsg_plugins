## Plugins

### 💽 blockrespawnswitch
Prevents players from forcing a respawn by switching teams/class during an active round.  
Designed to stop round abuse and enforce fair play in competitive matches.

- ✅ Blocks immediate respawn when changing class in spawn areas
- ✅ Works for both Allied and Axis teams
- ✅ Respects server class limits (mp_limit_* cvars)
- ✅ Shows "You will respawn as [class]" message to players

### 💽 sprintblock
Blocks or restricts sprint usage to align movement mechanics with competitive or custom rule sets.

The plugin uses `SDKHook_PreThink` to monitor player inputs every server tick (66 tick servers). It:

1. **Tracks button press order**: Detects whether Sprint or Forward was pressed first
2. **Monitors stamina recovery**: Flags when a player's stamina reaches 100%
3. **Applies penalty**: If the exploit pattern is detected, forces stamina to drop on next sprint activation

### 💽 dodsg_firstpersoncam (Forces First Person POV while dead)
This plugin enhances the spectator experience by automatically forcing first-person camera when observing teammates after death. Players can still switch between teammates normally, but the view is locked to first-person perspective.

- ✅ Automatic first-person view when observing teammates
- ✅ 5 second delay after death before forcing the camera mode
- ✅ Players can freely switch between teammates
- ✅ Prevents switching to third-person or free-look modes
- ✅ Lightweight and optimized performance

**Recommended Server Configuration**
Add `dod_freezecam 0` to your `server.cfg` to disable the default killcam.

### 💽 dodsg_ftb (Fade to Black)
A modern SourceMod plugin for Day of Defeat: Source that implements a realistic "Fade to Black" effect when players die.

- ✅ Instant black screen fade on death
- ✅ Configurable fade speed and duration
- ✅ Customizable RGB colors
- ✅ Auto-enables on installation
- ✅ Optimized performance (unhooks when disabled)

**Available Commands**
```
dodsg_ftb_enabled 1      // Enable/disable plugin (default: 1)
dodsg_ftb_speed 0.5      // Fade transition speed in seconds (default: 0.5) (0.1 = very fast, 2.0 = slow)
dodsg_ftb_delay 5.0      // Duration to stay black in seconds (default: 5.0)
dodsg_ftb_red 0          // Red color value 0-255 (default: 0)
dodsg_ftb_green 0        // Green color value 0-255 (default: 0)
dodsg_ftb_blue 0         // Blue color value 0-255 (default: 0)
