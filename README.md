## Plugins

### blockrespawnswitch
Prevents players from forcing a respawn by switching teams/class during an active round.  
Designed to stop round abuse and enforce fair play in competitive matches.

- ✅ Blocks immediate respawn when changing class in spawn areas
- ✅ Works for both Allied and Axis teams
- ✅ Respects server class limits (mp_limit_* cvars)
- ✅ Shows "You will respawn as [class]" message to players


### sprintblock
Blocks or restricts sprint usage to align movement mechanics with competitive or custom rule sets.

The plugin uses `SDKHook_PreThink` to monitor player inputs every server tick (66 tick servers). It:

1. **Tracks button press order**: Detects whether Sprint or Forward was pressed first
2. **Monitors stamina recovery**: Flags when a player's stamina reaches 100%
3. **Applies penalty**: If the exploit pattern is detected, forces stamina to drop on next sprint activation

**Performance**
- **CPU Usage**: < 0.01% on servers with up to 32 players
- **Memory**: ~16 bytes per player
- **Network**: No additional network traffic
- **Optimized**: Uses native Source Engine functions for maximum efficiency
